## Make It Yours!

Follow these 3 easy steps...

### 1. Run it locally

Paste this into your terminal to clone the repo, install dependencies, and get it runnning on http://localhost:3000.

```bash
# clone repo

### 2. Update the resume

Edit the site by modifying `data/resume.ts`. Show off your experience, projects, education, etc.

I personally use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to host my site for free. They're simple, easy to use, and even keep your site updated with git.
