Source code for my [Personal Website](https://kodydeda.netlify.app), built with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs) & [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/).

## üéÅ Make It Yours!

Getting started is easy. Follow these 3 steps...

### 1. Get it running locally

Copy & paste this into your terminal to clone the repo, install dependencies, and get your site runnning locally on http://localhost:3000.

```bash
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/kodydeda4/react-kodydeda website

# install dependencies
cd website
yarn

# run locally
yarn dev
```

### 2. Update the resume

Edit the `resume.ts` file to show off your experience, projects, education, etc. The site will automatically re-render to show the changes!
```
website/data/resume.ts
```

### 3. Get it hosted

I use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to host my site for free. They're simple, easy to use, and keep the site synced through git. Highly recommend!
